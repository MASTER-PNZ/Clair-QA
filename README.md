# Clair-QA Test Assessment: Google Cypress Tests

- Here is a simple Cypress framework with E2E tests written in JavaScript
- The tests verify certain critical functions of the Google Homepage 
- I used test data that was fun and relevant to my life and hobbies
- It was tricky to find locaters that would reliably work as Google likes to obscure names for security
- I hooked Cypress up to the cloud so I can also watch runs over time and view screenshots and videos
